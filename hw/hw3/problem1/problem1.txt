#this one did not seem to do too much. in fact, i think i just barely caught
#this strange "SYN_SENT" thingy. maybe the original code doesnt do too much out
#of the box, and maybe i should have modified it to do a bit more. but alas, here
#we are. maybe i did something wrong? who knows. networks are jank.
